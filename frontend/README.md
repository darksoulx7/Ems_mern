# Frontend Setup

## Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   - In your terminal, go to the `frontend` folder:
     ```
     cd frontend
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   - After the installation is complete, start the frontend development server with:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

## Note 

- Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend application, as the frontend will need to communicate with the backend.
